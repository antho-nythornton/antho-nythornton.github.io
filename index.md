### CPSC 120 

* [Lab 5](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-05-sam-n-and-anthony-t)
Lab 5, part 3 is my favorite, because it showed me how blackjack worked and how a simple number adding generator could be made. I liked being able to utilize the auto function in this lab and the adding operator to be able to add together the numbers and then be able to detect whether you went over the number and tell you that you lost or let you keep on playing. I also liked being able to implement the cold and warm function in this lab. 

* [Lab 9](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-09-anthonyt2)
Lab 9, part 2 is my favorite, because it showed me how to implement a code that would check a text file and see if it had any spelling errors and it would display the errors to the user. This amazed me at first when I was working on it, because I had always wondered how the different programs that would search for spelling errors worked and I finally was able to create a rudimentary one! This also had me working we using functions and return values which I felt was really cool to get the exposure to it. 

* [Lab 8](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-08-anthonyt)
Lab 8, part 3 is my favorite , because it dealt with integrating and creating a code that would be able to display a basic animation. This had me working with the input stream and input file operators. This allowed us to take a text file that we would inpute into the terminal and using the input file operator it would take the command line and turn it into the correct format and the input stream operator would open it. This also gave me exposure into learning when the input stream was open and how that would affect the rest of the code. This also used timing intervals to be able to open the different animations which I felt was really cool exposure to start coding and working on this type of code and technology.
